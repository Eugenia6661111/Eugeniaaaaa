                      <h2>Life</h2>
                      <p>Eric Chou was born in Taiwan on 22 June 1995. He has two brothers—younger brother Jimmy/James, and older brother Alex (周予天) who is also active as a singer-songwriter. At a young age, he learned chess to improve his character, and even won a championship. When he was nine, his uncle brought him to watch Jay Chou's concert rehearsal. "When I heard him sing ‘Hair Like Snow’, that was the moment I was determined to become a singer-songwriter like him," Chou said.At the age of twelve, he moved with his family to Boston in the United States, where he attended Fay School and Northfield Mount Hermon School. Chou recalled not being able to sit still when he first started learning the piano and had to be forced by his mother. However, playing the piano had become his outlet to express his emotions and started to play more during his spare time when he was in the US. His inspiration for songwriting comes from movies, his friends and personal experiences.During his time in Boston, he wrote the song, "The Distance of Love", inspired by his failed attempt to impress a girl he liked from high school."I thought I'd really get into music to make myself appear more charming, and that was actually the initial motivation," Chou said.At eighteen, Chou returned to Taiwan due to his parents' work in Shanghai.</p>
